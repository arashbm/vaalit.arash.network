I am a university researcher with a PhD in complex systems—systems with many interconnected parts exhibiting rich and complex behaviour. I completed my master's degree at Aalto University on **the accessibility and robustness of public transport networks**, comparing the Helsinki metropolitan area public transport system with those of 19 other major cities. My findings showed that some traditional and commonly used methods of assessing network resilience often perform no better than pure guesswork, emphasising the need for modern, data-driven solutions in decision-making.

During my doctoral studies, also at Aalto University, I investigated how diseases and information spread. I have published research articles on **epidemic modeling**, the effectiveness of **contact tracing**, and **quarantines**. I analysed the mathematics and physics underpinning disease transmission.

I'm passionate about bringing evidence-based thinking to local governance. My background provides valuable tools for addressing municipal and well-being challenges—from ensuring robust transport networks to planning effective health interventions.

In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with electronics, playing board games, and reading science fiction. I also dedicate some of my free time to maintaining and contributing to open-source software.
