According to the Trade Union of Education (OAJ), privatisation of early
childhood education [turns children into commodities][private]. The
introduction of the voucher system has made this problem worse. We are already
seeing the involvement of large chain companies, and a similar practice being
promoted for healthcare.

Public healthcare and education systems are like stained glass windows: it
takes years to gather the resources and the talent to build it up, but a moment
of weakness to break it down. Now that the government is deliberately throwing
stones at our institutions, municipal and regional government must step in to
protect our future.

Instead, we should be investing in healthcare and education. **The solution is
not Americanisation of healthcare and education but to invest in them**. By
making Espoo and Western Uusimaa the best employers we can, we attract new
workforce and make education and healthcare an enticing career choice.
